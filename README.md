## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

| Component | Specification | Quantity |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Microcontroller** | NUCLEO-F411RE (STM32F411RE) | 1 |
| **LED Display** | WS2812B 8x8 LED Matrix | 1 |
| **Input Device** | 8x8 Keyboard Matrix | 1 |
| **I/O Expander** | PCF8574 Module (Optional) | 1 |
| **Power Supply** | 5V Power Supply (for LEDs) | 1 |
| **Miscellaneous** | Jumper wires, Breadboard | As needed |

### Pin Configuration

The exact pin configuration depends on your setup, but typically:
- **WS2812B Data Pin**: Connected to a GPIO pin configured for PWM/DMA output
- **Keyboard Matrix**: Connected to GPIO pins (8 rows + 8 columns)
- **PCF8574 (Optional)**: Connected via I2C (SCL/SDA)

> **Note**: Check the `.ioc` file for the exact pin configuration used in this project.

## 💻 Software Requirements

- **IDE**: STM32CubeIDE
- **Programmer**: ST-LINK (built into Nucleo board)
- **Optional**: Serial terminal for debugging (9600 baud)

## 🔌 Hardware Setup

### 1. WS2812B LED Matrix Connection

```
STM32F411RE    →    WS2812B Matrix
────────────────────────────────
PB0            →    DIN (Data Input)
5V (External)  →    VCC
GND            →    GND
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: WS2812B LEDs can draw significant current. Use an external 5V power supply for the LED matrix. The Nucleo board's 5V pin may not provide sufficient current.

### 2. Keyboard Matrix Connection

Connect the 8x8 keyboard matrix to GPIO pins:
- 8 pins for rows
- 8 pins for columns

Configure these pins in the `.ioc` file using STM32CubeMX.

### 3. Optional PCF8574 I/O Expander

```
STM32F411RE    →    PCF8574
──────────────────────────
PB8 (SCL)      →    SCL
PB9 (SDA)      →    SDA
3.3V           →    VCC
GND            →    GND
```

## 📥 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu0901/A_Snake_Game.git
cd A_Snake_Game
```

### Step 2: Open in STM32CubeIDE

1. Launch **STM32CubeIDE**
2. Go to `File` → `Open Projects from File System`
3. Browse to the cloned repository folder
4. Click `Finish`

### Step 3: Build the Project

1. Select the project in the Project Explorer
2. Click `Project` → `Build All` (or press `Ctrl+B`)
3. Wait for the build to complete successfully

### Step 4: Flash to Nucleo Board

1. Connect your NUCLEO-F411RE board via USB
2. Click `Run` → `Debug` (or press `F11`)
3. The program will be flashed to the microcontroller
4. Click `Resume` to start execution

### Step 5: Configure AI Mode (Optional)

To enable the AI autoplay feature:

1. Open `Core/Inc/main.h`
2. Add or uncomment the following line:
   ```c
   #define AI
   ```
3. Rebuild the project (`Ctrl+B`)
4. Flash to the board again

When AI mode is enabled, the snake will play automatically using a Hamiltonian cycle algorithm with path optimization for efficient gameplay.

## 🎯 Game Controls

Use the keyboard matrix to control the snake:

| Key Direction | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Up Arrow      | Move Up |
| Down Arrow    | Move Down |
| Left Arrow    | Move Left |
| Right Arrow   | Move Right |

> **Note**: The exact key mapping depends on your keyboard matrix layout. Check the code to customize key assignments.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### WS2812B Control 
```c
WS2812B.h/.c
Display.h/.c
```

The WS2812B LEDs are controlled using PWM with DMA for precise timing. Each LED requires 24 bits of data (8 bits each for Red, Green, and Blue). The LEDs are daisy-chained, so data is shifted through all 64 LEDs sequentially.

**Timing Requirements:**
- **T0H**: 0.4µs ± 150ns (Logic 0, high time)
- **T0L**: 0.85µs ± 150ns (Logic 0, low time)
- **T1H**: 0.8µs ± 150ns (Logic 1, high time)
- **T1L**: 0.45µs ± 150ns (Logic 1, low time)
- **Reset**: >50µs low

### Game Logic 
```c
Game.h/.c
Input.h/.c
Canvas.h/.c
```

The game runs in a main loop that:
1. Reads keyboard input
2. Updates snake position
3. Checks for collisions (walls, self)
4. Checks for food collection
5. Updates LED matrix display
6. Adds delay for game speed control


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### LEDs Not Lighting Up

- **Check power supply**: Ensure the WS2812B matrix has adequate 5V power.
- **Verify data pin**: Confirm the correct GPIO pin is configured for PWM output.
- **Timing issues**: WS2812B requires precise timing. Check your timer configuration.

### Keyboard Not Responding

- **Check connections**: Verify all row and column pins are correctly connected.
- **Pin configuration**: Ensure GPIO pins are configured correctly (input with pull-up/pull-down).
- **Debouncing**: Add software debouncing if keys are registering multiple times.

### Game Runs Too Fast/Slow

Adjust tick rates in the Game.h to control game speed.
